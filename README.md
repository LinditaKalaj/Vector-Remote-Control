🚧 Stand-alone exe in progress 🚧
 
A GUI used enable control of Vector (Anki / DDL (Digital Dream Labs)) through your computer.

## Whats the point of this program?

Anki / DDL (Digital Dream Labs) does not provide an easy way for their users to control vector like a remote controlled robot. 
Luckily they have provided a Python SDK which allows people to have access to his periferials and other attributes.
With this program you can make Vector move, control his speed, speak any text that has been given to him, view his camera, make him dance/animate, and utilize GPT API to have Vector voice Chat GPT responses as a sassy robot assistant.


## Prerequisites

In order to use this you must first obtain a certificate for Vector. Luckiy I have made a program that allows this to be easily done. It can be found here: [Vector Setup](https://github.com/LinditaKalaj/Vector-Setup)
